# YourShipping.Monitor

YourShipping (a.k.a. TuEnvio) has no public monitoring and notifications options. This is a basic app to monitoring specific departments and products from its well-known uri.

The goal is "similar" to [camelcamelcamel](https://camelcamelcamel.com) but in this case the target is [TuEnvio](https://www.tuenvio.cu/).
